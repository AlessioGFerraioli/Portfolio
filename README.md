# Portfolio
My Portfolio, as an exercise.

You can visit the portfolio website [here](https://alessiogferraioli.github.io/Portfolio/).

This is a **work in progress** for a personal portfolio project that I'm building as an excercise while I'm learning web design.

The code is very messy since I am very new to html css and javascript.
